# Test for Kaffein's rookies

## Instructions
From the analysis of the given graphic template, build the corresponding HTML page. 
You have to use the given assets and the instructions given in the [following document](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/944ab5f9-1135-499c-4f1a-5d83c89411bb-e27b/) (click the </> symbol for instructions).
The template has been created for a desktop display (from 1024 to 1920px width), a bonus is given for the RWD upgrade.

## Restrictions
You can start from scratch or use an integration framework but you must respect the template and its design as much as possible. 
3 elements are essential:
- first, the "Where does your business stand?" section is made up of 4 blocks that appear one after the other when the user clicks on his title (Idea, start-up, scale up, invest),
- the next section contains numbers that need to be animated (for example from 0 to 2500) when the user scrolls down,
- the last news section is a carousel displaying 6 news items in batches of 3.
There are no instructions about hover effects, you have to imagine them.  All modern integration techniques are accepted, be creative! 

## Goals
You shall create a git branch with your name and integrate as many elements of the template as possible in the time allowed. 
The quality and the respect of the norms and standards will be judged.
